# Arc
I am developing this operating system as I explore the amazing world of osdev.

## Status
Interrupts implementation complete:
- Installing ISRs
- Loading IDT
- Handling interrupts

## Note
This is the main branch, and this is where you will find the latest stable commit that should build without any errors.  
Checkout the dev branch for the latest updates!

## Build
- Clone this repository with the `--recurse-submodules` flag to initialize and update the limine submodule.
- `$ make run` to build the iso and launch qemu!
