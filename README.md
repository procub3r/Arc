# Arc
I am developing this operating system as I explore the amazing world of osdev.

## Status
Working on the IDT and handling ISRs.

## Note
This is the dev branch, and this is where I develop this project, so the code may or may not compile.  
Checkout the main branch for the latest stable commit.

## Build
- Clone this repository with the `--recurse-submodules` flag to initialize and update the limine submodule.
- `$ make run` to build the iso and launch qemu!
